This repository showcases my data analysis skills using Microsoft Power BI! I developed these skills through the Maven Analytics Power BI Desktop course. 🚀 Here, I've transformed raw data into insightful reports and dashboards for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. Let's dive in! 👇


## 🎯 Project Overview

As a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, my goal was to create professional-quality reports and dashboards. These tools track key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product trends, and identify high-value customers. 💰



### Dashboard File
My final dashboard is in [AdventureWorks BI Project File](/Workbook-Final-A.pbix)
